- **Fallback .ics download** for non-Google calendar users

## User Experience Impact:

- **Sarah Kim** relies on Google Calendar for managing her busy professional schedule
- **Jordan Park** may need simple Google account authentication for calendar access

**This requirement is essential for client satisfaction and must be prioritized in all development planning and user experience design.**
