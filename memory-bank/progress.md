### 🐛 **Major Issues Encountered & Fixed**
1. **Supabase Build Configuration Crisis**
   - Problem: Mixed client/server imports causing build failures
   - Solution: Separated into `lib/supabase.ts` (client) and `lib/supabase-server.ts` (server)
   - Root Cause: Template mixed Next.js patterns incorrectly

2. **Environment Variable Build-Time Errors**
   - Problem: Supabase accessing env vars during build when unavailable
   - Solution: Added fallback values and conditional initialization
   - Prevention: Build-time safety patterns needed in template

3. **Middleware Authentication Complexity**
   - Problem: Middleware crashed during build due to `next/headers` usage
   - Solution: Environment checks and graceful error handling
   - Fix: Production-ready middleware with proper async patterns

4. **Missing CI/CD Infrastructure**
   - Problem: No automated testing or deployment pipeline
   - Solution: Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow
   - Addition: Complete testing, building, and deployment automation

5. **Incomplete Package Scripts**
