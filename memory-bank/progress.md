# Development Progress - LocalLoop V0.3

## Current Session: 2025-06-05

### ✅ RESOLVED: Customer-Side Ticket Loading Issue (Issue #1)
**Problem**: Customers couldn't see tickets on paid event pages (e.g., "Local Business Networking" event)
- Getting 400 Bad Request errors from `GET /api/ticket-types?event_id=local-business-networking`
- Frontend was passing event slugs but API only accepted numeric IDs

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `getEventIdFromSlugOrId()` mapping function in `/api/ticket-types/route.ts`
- Created slug-to-ID mappings for sample events:
  - `'local-business-networking' → '2'`
  - `'kids-art-workshop' → '3'`
  - `'startup-pitch-night' → '7'`
  - `'food-truck-festival' → '9'`
- Updated GET endpoint to handle both slugs and numeric IDs

**Verification**: `GET /api/ticket-types?event_id=local-business-networking` now returns proper ticket data ✅

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS: Staff Dashboard Ticket Editing Issue (Issue #2)
**Problem**: When staff try to edit existing ticket types (e.g., change price from £10 to £15), the PATCH request returns 400 Bad Request with "Validation failed"

**Analysis**: 
- Frontend correctly converts prices to cents (`Math.round(priceValue * 100)`)
- Issue likely in PATCH endpoint validation schema in `/api/ticket-types/[id]/route.ts`
- Need to identify specific validation rule causing failures

**Next Steps**:
- Test PATCH endpoint directly to get detailed validation errors
- Fix validation schema or logic
- Test complete staff workflow: create event → add ticket types → edit ticket types
