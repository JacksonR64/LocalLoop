## 5. Search Functionality Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Implement robust search functionality across event listings
### Details:
Create a search system that allows users to find events by keywords, categories, or other relevant criteria. Include autocomplete suggestions and handle empty search states appropriately.
<info added on 2025-05-29T12:54:57.036Z>
Implementation in progress for the event search system. Developing keyword search functionality that works across event titles, descriptions, and categories. Adding autocomplete suggestion feature to improve user experience and implementing proper handling for empty search states. All implementation findings and technical details will be documented throughout the development process.
</info added on 2025-05-29T12:54:57.036Z>
<info added on 2025-05-29T12:56:21.637Z>
Autocomplete suggestions have been successfully implemented in the event search bar. The feature displays a dropdown of matching event titles, categories, and locations as users type. The implementation supports both keyboard navigation and mouse selection of suggestions, which then automatically updates the search query and filters the results accordingly. The autocomplete component has been built with accessibility considerations in mind, including proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support. Mobile responsiveness has been ensured with appropriate touch targets and dropdown behavior on smaller screens. Next development focus will be on enhancing the empty state handling when search queries return no results, with plans to implement helpful suggestions and alternative content to guide users.
</info added on 2025-05-29T12:56:21.637Z>
<info added on 2025-05-29T12:56:42.633Z>
Empty state handling has been successfully implemented for the search and filter system. When no events match the user's search criteria or selected filters, a helpful message is now displayed informing users that no results were found. The empty state includes a prominent button allowing users to clear all filters with a single click, as well as suggestions to adjust their search terms or filter criteria to broaden results. This implementation significantly improves user experience by providing clear guidance when searches return no results, preventing user frustration and abandonment. With this enhancement, the search functionality implementation is now complete and ready for integration with the main event discovery interface.

</info added on 2025-05-29T12:56:56.558Z>
<info added on 2025-05-29T13:10:56.763Z>
Implementation completed: Successfully built both pagination and infinite scroll functionality for event listings. Created custom React hooks (usePagination and useInfiniteScroll) to manage data fetching and state. Integrated LoadingSpinner component to provide visual feedback during data loading. The final implementation loads 8 events initially and fetches additional events as users scroll down the page. Added appropriate loading indicators and end-of-list messages to improve user experience. All components compile successfully with no errors. Position memory functionality preserves scroll position when users navigate back to listings. Performance testing shows smooth transitions even with large datasets. This subtask is now complete and ready to move on to SSR/ISR and Mobile Responsiveness Implementation.
