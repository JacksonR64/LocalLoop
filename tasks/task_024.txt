# Task ID: 24
# Title: Fix Stripe Checkout Flow and Payment Integration Issues
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9, 3, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve critical checkout API validation failures, database ticket type ID mismatches, price calculation errors, frontend infinite API loops, and restore complete PaymentIntent creation functionality for all paid events.
# Details:
This task involves fixing several critical issues in the Stripe payment integration:

1. Database ticket type ID mismatches:
   - Identify and correct mismatches between ticket type IDs in the database and those referenced in the checkout flow
   - Ensure consistent data structure between frontend requests and database schema
   - Add validation to prevent future mismatches

2. Remove dependency on non-existent database columns:
   - Audit code for references to columns that don't exist in the current schema
   - Refactor code to use existing columns or add necessary columns if required
   - Update database queries and API endpoints accordingly

3. Fix price calculation errors:
   - Correct the decimal handling in price calculations (e.g., $2400 showing instead of $24.00)
   - Ensure consistent currency formatting throughout the application
   - Implement proper rounding and decimal place handling for all monetary values
   - Add validation to prevent invalid price inputs

4. Eliminate infinite API loops in frontend components:
   - Debug and fix React component lifecycle issues causing infinite API calls
   - Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect hooks
   - Add request throttling or debouncing where appropriate
   - Ensure proper error handling to prevent cascading API failures

5. Restore PaymentIntent creation functionality:
   - Fix the Stripe PaymentIntent creation process for all paid events
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation in the payment flow
   - Verify webhook handling for payment confirmations
   - Test the complete checkout flow for various ticket types and quantities

Implementation should follow Stripe's best practices for checkout flows and ensure proper error handling throughout the process. Update any related documentation to reflect the changes made.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write unit tests for price calculation functions to verify correct decimal handling
   - Test database queries with mock data to ensure proper ticket type ID handling
   - Verify PaymentIntent creation with Stripe test mode

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the complete checkout flow with various ticket types and quantities
   - Verify proper handling of edge cases (zero quantity, maximum limits, etc.)
   - Test with both guest checkout and logged-in users

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Complete test purchases using Stripe test cards for various scenarios (success, failure, 3D Secure)
   - Verify order creation in the database after successful payments
   - Test webhook handling for payment confirmations

4. Performance Testing:
   - Monitor API call frequency to ensure infinite loops are resolved
   - Verify response times for checkout API endpoints
   - Test under load to ensure stability

5. Regression Testing:
   - Verify that all paid events can successfully process payments
   - Ensure existing orders and tickets remain valid
   - Check that event detail pages correctly display ticket information

6. Manual Testing Checklist:
   - Verify correct price display throughout the checkout process
   - Test with multiple browsers and devices
   - Confirm proper error messages for validation failures
   - Verify successful receipt/confirmation emails after purchase
