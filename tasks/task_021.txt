# Task ID: 21
# Title: Fix Image Loading Errors and Next.js Deprecation Warnings
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 6, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve issues with farmers-market images returning HTML instead of actual images and replace deprecated onLoadingComplete with onLoad property in Next.js Image components.
# Details:
This task involves fixing two distinct issues in the application:

1. **Farmers-market Images Loading Issue**:
   - Investigate why farmers-market images are returning HTML instead of actual image data
   - Check the image source URLs in the application code
   - Verify the API endpoint or static file path that serves these images
   - Inspect network requests to identify if there's a routing issue or server misconfiguration
   - Check if there's a redirect happening that's serving an HTML error page instead of image content
   - Ensure proper MIME types are being set for image responses
   - Fix the issue by either:
     - Correcting image paths in the application
     - Fixing server configuration for image serving
     - Implementing proper error handling for image loading failures

2. **Next.js Image Component Deprecation Warnings**:
   - Identify all instances of `onLoadingComplete` property usage in Next.js Image components
   - Replace each occurrence with the newer `onLoad` property
   - Example change:
     ```jsx
     // Before
     <Image 
       src="/images/event.jpg"
       alt="Event image"
       width={500}
       height={300}
       onLoadingComplete={(img) => handleImageLoad(img)}
     />
     
     // After
     <Image 
       src="/images/event.jpg"
       alt="Event image"
       width={500}
       height={300}
       onLoad={(event) => handleImageLoad(event.target)}
     />
     ```
   - Note that the parameter passed to the callback function differs between the two properties:
     - `onLoadingComplete` receives the image element directly
     - `onLoad` receives an event object, so you need to use `event.target` to access the image element
   - Update any related TypeScript types or interfaces if necessary
   - Test that image loading callbacks still function correctly after the changes

3. **General Image Optimization Check**:
   - While fixing these issues, also verify that all images are properly optimized using Next.js Image component
   - Ensure proper image sizes are specified
   - Check that appropriate image formats are being used (WebP where supported)
   - Verify lazy loading is implemented correctly

# Test Strategy:
1. **Testing Farmers-market Image Loading**:
   - Manually navigate to pages displaying farmers-market images and verify they load correctly
   - Inspect network requests in browser developer tools to confirm images are loading with proper content type
   - Test image loading on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure cross-browser compatibility
   - Test on mobile devices to verify responsive image loading
   - Create a simple automated test that checks if images are loading with the correct MIME type
   - Verify no console errors related to image loading

2. **Testing Next.js Image Component Changes**:
   - Create a comprehensive list of all files where `onLoadingComplete` was replaced with `onLoad`
   - Manually verify each instance to ensure the callback functionality works as expected
   - Check browser console for any deprecation warnings related to Next.js Image components
   - Test image loading events by adding temporary console logs in the callback functions
   - Verify that any functionality dependent on image loading events (like showing placeholders or triggering animations) still works correctly
   - Run the application in development mode with strict mode enabled to catch any remaining deprecation warnings

3. **Regression Testing**:
   - Run existing automated tests to ensure the changes haven't broken any functionality
   - Perform visual regression testing on pages with images to ensure layouts haven't been affected
   - Check performance metrics before and after changes to verify image loading performance hasn't degraded
