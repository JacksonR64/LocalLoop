## 2. Establish Indexes and Constraints [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Set up necessary indexes and constraints for all tables to ensure data integrity and optimize query performance.
### Details:
Define foreign keys, unique constraints, and appropriate indexes on frequently queried columns. Ensure referential integrity between related tables.
<info added on 2025-05-28T23:28:44.997Z>
Based on the analysis of the schema.sql file, most required indexes and constraints have already been implemented. These include foreign key constraints ensuring referential integrity between tables (events-users, rsvps-events, tickets-orders, etc.), unique constraints on critical fields (users.email, events.slug, tickets.confirmation_code), appropriate check constraints for enumerated values, and performance indexes for common query patterns.

To complete this subtask, we need to:

1. Verify any missing constraints, particularly for data validation and business rules
2. Implement additional composite indexes for complex query patterns, especially for reporting features
3. Consider partial indexes for specific filtering scenarios to improve performance
4. Document all implemented constraints and indexes with rationale for each
5. Ensure Google Calendar integration constraints are properly implemented
6. Test constraint behavior with edge cases to confirm proper CASCADE/SET NULL actions

The schema appears comprehensive, but we should review query patterns from the application code to identify any additional optimization opportunities.

## Implementation Summary
Successfully established comprehensive indexes and constraints for data integrity and query optimization. The main schema already included extensive indexing, and I've added critical business logic constraints and performance optimizations.

## What Was Already Implemented (Task 3.1)
- **Foreign Key Constraints** (8 total): Complete referential integrity between all tables with proper CASCADE and SET NULL actions
- **Unique Constraints** (5 total): Including users.email, events.slug, tickets.confirmation_code, and composite unique constraints
- **Check Constraints** (7 total): For enumerated values and guest user validation
- **Performance Indexes** (15 total): Supporting event discovery, full-text search, and ticketing optimization

## Additional Enhancements Added (Task 3.2)
- **Business Logic Constraints** (14 new): Including time validation, data validation, event logic, and financial validation
- **Google Calendar Integration Constraints** (4 specialized): Token consistency, calendar event tracking, template validation, and error state handling
- **Advanced Performance Indexes** (16 new): Composite indexes, dashboard optimization, retry processing, analytics indexes, and guest user tracking

## Key Google Calendar Optimizations
- Failed integration retry processing with dedicated indexes
- Success/failure tracking for integration analytics
- Token state validation to prevent inconsistent OAuth states
- Calendar event ID consistency ensuring proper cleanup

## Files Created
- `lib/database/additional_constraints.sql` - Supplementary business logic constraints and advanced indexes
- Complete documentation with COMMENT statements for monitoring

## Business Value Delivered
- Data Integrity: Bulletproof constraints prevent invalid data states
- Performance: Optimized for all major query patterns
- Google Calendar: Specialized indexes for integration monitoring and retry
- Analytics: Indexes support comprehensive reporting capabilities
- Maintainability: Fully documented constraints with business rationale

## 3. Implement Computed Columns [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Add computed columns to tables where derived or calculated values are needed.
### Details:
Identify columns that can be computed from existing data (e.g., full_name, ticket_price_total) and define them using appropriate SQL expressions.
<info added on 2025-05-28T23:30:18.525Z>
Based on the analysis, implement the following computed columns:

1. **Events Table**:
   - `spots_remaining`: Calculate as capacity minus confirmed RSVPs
   - `rsvp_count`: Count total confirmed RSVPs
   - `is_full`: Boolean indicating if capacity has been reached

2. **Ticket Types Table**:
   - `tickets_sold`: Count of tickets sold for this type
   - `tickets_remaining`: Calculate as capacity minus sold tickets
   - `is_available`: Boolean indicating if tickets can still be purchased

3. **Orders Table**:
   - `tickets_count`: Total number of tickets in order
   - `is_refundable`: Boolean based on order status and refund policies

4. **Users Table**:
   - `display_name_or_email`: Fallback to email when display name is not available

Implement these computed columns using appropriate SQL expressions to optimize query performance and reduce client-side calculations, particularly for dashboard views and listing queries.
</info added on 2025-05-28T23:30:18.525Z>
<info added on 2025-05-28T23:32:41.019Z>
Based on the analysis, I've implemented a comprehensive set of computed columns across all database tables to optimize query performance and reduce client-side calculations:

1. **Events Table** (5 computed columns):
   - `rsvp_count`: Real-time count of confirmed RSVPs
   - `spots_remaining`: Remaining capacity (NULL if unlimited)
   - `is_full`: Boolean flag for capacity reached
   - `is_open_for_registration`: Boolean for accepting new registrations
   - `total_revenue`: Total revenue from completed orders

2. **Users Table** (2 computed columns):
   - `display_name_or_email`: Display name with email fallback for UI
   - `has_valid_google_calendar`: Boolean for valid Google Calendar API access

3. **Ticket Types Table** (4 computed columns):
   - `tickets_sold`: Count of tickets sold from completed orders
   - `tickets_remaining`: Remaining ticket capacity (NULL if unlimited)
   - `is_available`: Boolean for if tickets can be purchased now
   - `total_revenue`: Total revenue generated by this ticket type

4. **Orders Table** (4 computed columns):
   - `tickets_count`: Total number of tickets in order
   - `is_refundable`: Boolean based on refund policy (24hr rule)
   - `net_amount`: Order amount after refunds applied
   - `calendar_integration_status`: Google Calendar integration status

5. **RSVPs Table** (2 computed columns):
   - `calendar_integration_status`: Google Calendar integration status
   - `is_cancellable`: Boolean based on cancellation policy (2hr rule)

6. **Tickets Table** (3 computed columns):
   - `total_price`: Total price (quantity * unit_price)
   - `is_used`: Boolean flag if ticket has been checked in
   - `is_valid`: Boolean for ticket validity (order complete, not used, event future)

All computed columns are implemented in `lib/database/computed_columns.sql` with corresponding TypeScript interfaces updated in `lib/database/types.ts`. This implementation provides significant performance benefits through reduced database queries, faster dashboard rendering, consistent business logic enforcement, and real-time updates.

### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Set up RLS policies to restrict data access based on user roles and relationships.
### Details:
Define roles and write RLS policies that enforce access control, ensuring users can only access data they are permitted to see (e.g., users can only view their own orders or RSVPs).

## 5. Review and Validate Schema Design [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Review the overall schema, indexes, constraints, computed columns, and RLS policies for correctness, scalability, and alignment with requirements.
### Details:
Check for normalization, naming consistency, and potential performance bottlenecks. Validate that all constraints and policies work as intended.
