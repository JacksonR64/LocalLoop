# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Production Environment Variables [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up all required environment variables and secrets in the CI/CD platform for production deployment.
### Details:
Create environment variables for database connection strings, API keys, service credentials, and application configuration. Use the CI/CD platform's secrets management to store sensitive information securely. Verify that all required variables are defined and accessible to the deployment workflow.

## 2. Implement Build and Test Pipeline Stages [done]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Create pipeline stages for building the application and running automated tests before deployment.
### Details:
Configure the CI/CD workflow to compile and bundle application assets for production. Set up test stages that run unit, integration, and critical E2E tests. Ensure the pipeline fails if tests don't pass. Optimize build process for production deployment by enabling appropriate optimizations.

## 3. Create Deployment Stage for Production [done]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Implement the deployment stage that pushes the application to the production hosting environment.
### Details:
Configure the deployment job to deploy the built application to the production server/environment. Include steps for any required pre-deployment tasks (e.g., database migrations). Set up proper authentication between CI/CD platform and hosting environment. Ensure deployment only proceeds if previous stages succeed.

## 4. Implement Health Checks and Smoke Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 29.3
### Description: Create post-deployment verification steps to confirm the application is functioning correctly.
### Details:
Develop health check endpoints that verify critical services are operational. Implement automated smoke tests that run against the deployed environment to verify core functionality. Configure the pipeline to run these checks immediately after deployment.

**Implementation Plan for Health Check Endpoint:**

1. Create `/api/health` endpoint for basic app health monitoring
   - Implement status code 200 for healthy services
   - Return appropriate error codes for service degradation

2. Add production environment checks
   - Verify correct environment variables are loaded
   - Confirm production-specific configurations are active

3. Include database connectivity verification
   - Test connection pool status
   - Verify read/write capabilities with simple query

4. Return JSON response with:
   - Overall system status
   - Individual component statuses
   - Current timestamp
   - Build version information
   - Response time metrics

**Health Check Requirements:**
- App server status (process uptime, memory usage)
- Database connection status (connection pool, query response time)
- Environment validation (correct config loaded)
- Build version info (git commit, build number)
- Response time metrics (endpoint response latency)

The health check endpoint will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to verify successful deployments before marking them as complete. Local testing will be performed prior to deployment to production.

## 5. Implement Rollback Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.3
### Description: Create automated and manual rollback procedures for handling deployment failures.
### Details:
Develop scripts to revert to the previous stable version. Configure automatic rollback triggers based on health check failures. Document manual rollback procedures for emergency situations. Ensure rollback preserves data integrity.

**Deployment Status Update:**

A deployment has been triggered through our CI/CD pipeline with commit `cddd022` containing comprehensive health endpoint implementation. The pipeline is currently executing the following stages:
- Code Quality (ESLint & TypeScript check)
- Build (Next.js production build)
- Tests (Unit and integration tests)
- E2E Tests (Playwright cross-browser testing)
- Deploy (Vercel production deployment)
- Health Check (New automated verification)

The health check implementation includes:
- Database connectivity with response time monitoring
- Environment variable validation
- App server health with memory metrics
- 5-attempt retry logic with 15s intervals
- Detailed logging in CI pipeline

These health checks will serve as potential triggers for our automatic rollback system if failures are detected. Once deployment completes, we'll verify the health checks at https://local-loop.vercel.app/api/health to ensure our rollback mechanisms are properly configured.

**CI/CD Pipeline Fix Update:**

The CI/CD pipeline issues have been successfully addressed with commit `cc013be`. The following fixes were implemented:
- Resolved health endpoint linting issues
- Fixed unused parameters in health endpoint
- Eliminated TypeScript `any` usage
- Removed unused variable declarations
- Maintained all functionality intact

All tests (125/125) are now passing locally, and a clean production build has been verified. The pipeline has been re-triggered through GitHub Actions CI/CD with the following expected stages to pass:
- Code Quality (ESLint checks)
- Build
- Tests
- E2E Tests
- Deploy to Vercel
- Health Check verification

This fix ensures our rollback mechanisms will have reliable health checks to trigger from. The team will monitor the new pipeline run, verify deployment health checks in production, and complete Task 29 deployment verification once successful.

## 6. Configure Monitoring and Alerting [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.4
### Description: Set up monitoring for deployment success/failure and application performance metrics.
### Details:
Configure alerts for deployment failures. Set up monitoring for key application metrics (response time, error rates). Integrate with existing monitoring systems. Ensure appropriate team members are notified of deployment status and any issues.

**Deployment Monitoring Status Update**

CI Pipeline is running successfully with the following progress:
- Linting issues have been fixed (ESLint errors resolved)
- Health endpoint tested locally with 442ms response time
- Pipeline currently "in_progress" and has passed initial stages
- Performance testing failed in a separate workflow (not blocking deployment)

Health endpoint verification shows all systems operational with database connectivity and environment variables passing checks.

Pipeline stages:
- Code Quality: Passed
- Build: Likely passed (pipeline still running)
- Tests: Currently executing
- E2E Tests: Pending
- Deploy: Pending
- Health Check: Pending

Monitoring will continue through pipeline completion, followed by testing the deployed health endpoint, verifying production deployment functionality, and completing the deployment verification checklist.
