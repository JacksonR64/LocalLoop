# Task ID: 17
# Title: Develop Automated Testing Strategy
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
# Details:
Use Playwright for E2E tests (RSVP, ticketing, calendar integration). Write unit tests for core logic. Implement integration tests for API endpoints. Include cross-browser and mobile testing.

# Test Strategy:
Run automated tests for all critical flows and verify coverage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up E2E testing framework [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the end-to-end testing infrastructure with appropriate tools and configuration
### Details:
Select an E2E testing tool (like Cypress, Playwright, or Selenium), install dependencies, create initial configuration files, and set up the basic project structure. Include environment configuration for different testing scenarios.

## E2E Testing Framework Status Update

### Discovery Findings
- Playwright is already installed (`@playwright/test` in devDependencies)
- Basic test script configured: `"test:e2e": "playwright test"`
- Example test file exists at `e2e/example.spec.ts` (homepage load test)
- Load testing with k6 is operational

### Identified Gaps
1. Missing or incomplete `playwright.config.ts` configuration
2. Limited E2E test coverage (only one basic test)
3. No cross-browser testing configuration
4. Lack of test data setup/teardown procedures
5. Missing tests for critical user flows (RSVP, ticketing, calendar)

### Action Items
1. Verify/create proper Playwright configuration with browser matrix
2. Implement test data management and environment configuration
3. Develop E2E tests for critical flows documented in TESTING-GUIDE.md
4. Set up reporting and CI integration

## E2E Testing Framework Implementation Complete

### Configuration
- Created comprehensive `playwright.config.ts` with:
  - Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
  - Mobile device testing (iPhone, iPad)
  - Environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/prod)
  - Multiple reporting formats (HTML, JSON, JUnit)
  - Global setup/teardown procedures
  - Screenshot and video capture for debugging
  - Performance optimizations

### Test Infrastructure
- Implemented complete testing utilities:
  - `e2e/global-setup.ts` for environment preparation and health checks
  - `e2e/global-teardown.ts` for cleanup and logging
  - `e2e/utils/test-helpers.ts` with comprehensive TestHelpers class including:
    - Navigation helpers for key application areas
    - Form filling utilities for RSVP, tickets, and authentication
    - Wait conditions and page load verification
    - Screenshot and debugging capabilities
    - Test data management
    - Success/error message verification

### Test Suites
- Created and enhanced test suites:
  - Updated `e2e/example.spec.ts` with 7 comprehensive basic tests
  - New `e2e/rsvp-flow.spec.ts` with 4 complete RSVP journey tests
  - New `e2e/ticket-flow.spec.ts` with 6 ticket purchasing flow tests

### Test Coverage
- Homepage loading and structure
- Event page display and functionality
- Complete RSVP flows including authentication and validation
- Ticket purchasing processes
- Calendar integration verification
- API endpoint testing
- Navigation flow testing
- Mobile responsiveness
- Form validation
- Error handling scenarios

### Framework Features
- Robust error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Authentication-aware testing
- Payment flow testing (simulated)
- Cross-browser and mobile device compatibility testing
- Comprehensive logging and reporting

All identified gaps from the previous status update have been addressed, and the framework is now production-ready with capability for extension.

## 2. Implement unit test coverage strategy [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a comprehensive unit testing approach focusing on code quality rather than just coverage percentage
### Details:
Define realistic code coverage goals, create small and focused tests, use descriptive test names, and ensure both positive and negative scenarios are covered. Implement mocks and stubs to isolate units being tested.

**Unit Testing Strategy Analysis & Planning**

üîç **CURRENT STATE DISCOVERED**:
- No unit testing framework currently installed
- Only E2E tests (Playwright) and load tests (k6) exist
- No existing unit test files found
- Next.js 15 project with TypeScript

üìã **UNIT TESTING STRATEGY PLAN**:

1. **Framework Selection**: Jest + React Testing Library
   - Industry standard for React/Next.js applications
   - Excellent TypeScript support
   - Built-in mocking capabilities
   - Snapshot testing for components

2. **Coverage Strategy**: Quality over quantity approach
   - Target 80% coverage for critical business logic
   - 100% coverage for utility functions
   - Focus on edge cases and error scenarios
   - Prioritize testing user-facing functionality

3. **Test Categories to Implement**:
   - **Component Tests**: UI components with user interactions
   - **API Route Tests**: Backend endpoint logic
   - **Utility Function Tests**: Helper functions and business logic
   - **Hook Tests**: Custom React hooks
   - **Integration Tests**: Component + API interactions

4. **Test Structure**:
   - Mirror source code directory structure
   - Descriptive test names following "should do X when Y" pattern
   - Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
   - Proper mocking of external dependencies

**NEXT ACTIONS**: Install Jest, React Testing Library, and configure testing environment
