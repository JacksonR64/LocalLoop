# Task ID: 16
# Title: Optimize Performance and Scalability
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement caching, image optimization, and database indexing for performance.
# Details:
Use Next.js ISR for event listings. Optimize images with next/image. Add database indexes for frequent queries. Monitor performance with Lighthouse and Supabase metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Test page load times, API response times, and database query performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up ISR for dynamic content that doesn't need real-time updates
### Details:
Configure ISR in your framework (Next.js, etc.), identify pages suitable for ISR, set appropriate revalidation intervals, implement fallback pages, and test caching behavior
<info added on 2025-06-05T09:00:06.480Z>
âœ… ISR Implementation Progress:

**Completed:**
- Added ISR to homepage (app/page.tsx) with 5-minute revalidation
- Added ISR to event detail page (app/events/[id]/page.tsx) with 15-minute revalidation
- Analyzed my-events page and determined it's not suitable for ISR (user-specific content)

**Implementation Details:**
- Homepage: `export const revalidate = 300` (5 minutes) - events change more frequently
- Event Detail: `export const revalidate = 900` (15 minutes) - individual events change less frequently
- Both pages were already Server Components, making ISR integration seamless

**Benefits:**
- Homepage will be statically generated and cached, improving TTFB
- Event detail pages will be pre-generated for popular events
- Automatic background revalidation ensures fresh content without user wait time

Ready to move to image optimization next.

<info added on 2025-06-05T09:24:27.772Z>
âœ… Image Optimization Implementation Complete:

**Completed Optimizations:**
- âœ… Verified all major components already use Next.js Image component correctly
- âœ… Added responsive `sizes` attributes to all EventCard variants for better loading performance
- âœ… Added `placeholder="blur"` with base64 blur data URL for better UX during loading

- âœ… Updated all email templates to use the new SVG logo

**Technical Details:**
- EventCard default: `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"`
- EventCard preview: `sizes="80px"` for small thumbnails
- EventCard full: Same responsive sizes as default
- All images now have blur placeholders for smoother loading experience
- SVG logo is infinitely scalable and optimized for email delivery

**Already Optimized (No Changes Needed):**
- Next.js Image component usage throughout app
- WebP/AVIF format support in next.config.ts
- Proper alt attributes for accessibility
- Priority loading for above-the-fold images
- Lazy loading by default
- 24-hour image caching configured

**Performance Impact:**

# Database Indexing Implementation Complete

## Applied Strategic Indexes:
- `idx_events_status_time` - Optimizes event listings with status filtering and time ordering

- `idx_events_capacity_check` - Speeds up event availability and capacity validation
- `idx_orders_stripe_processing` - Optimizes Stripe webhook processing
- `idx_events_analytics` - Optimizes event analytics and reporting queries

## Database Analysis Results:
- Database already had comprehensive indexing (40+ existing indexes)
- Added 10 additional strategic indexes targeting specific query patterns
- All indexes include proper WHERE clauses for partial index optimization
- Focused on homepage queries, admin dashboards, capacity checks, and analytics

## Performance Impact Expected:
- Faster homepage and event listing queries
- Improved admin dashboard performance for organizers
- Faster RSVP and capacity calculations
- Optimized Google Calendar integration operations
- Better performance for analytics and reporting

## Migration Applied Successfully:
- Migration `performance_optimization_indexes` applied to Supabase
