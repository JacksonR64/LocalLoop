# Task ID: 26
# Title: Code Repository Cleanup and Organization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a feature branch for comprehensive cleanup of development files, reorganize misplaced files, remove temporary files via .gitignore, and ensure all file references are correct while maintaining functionality.
# Details:
This task involves a systematic cleanup and organization of the codebase to improve maintainability and developer experience:

1. Create a new feature branch named `cleanup/repo-organization` from the main development branch.

2. File Organization:
   - Identify and move misplaced files to their appropriate directories based on project structure conventions
   - Group related components, utilities, and test files logically
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions across the codebase
   - Update import paths in all affected files

3. .gitignore Management:
   - Review and update the .gitignore file to exclude:
     - Temporary files (*.tmp, *.temp)
     - IDE-specific files (.vscode/, .idea/)
     - Build artifacts (dist/, build/, .next/)
     - Environment files (.env.local, .env.development.local)
     - Log files (*.log)
     - Node modules (node_modules/)
   - Ensure that any necessary local configuration files are kept locally but not committed

4. Dependency Cleanup:
   - Remove unused dependencies from package.json
   - Update outdated dependencies to compatible versions
   - Resolve any dependency conflicts

5. Code Standardization:
   - Ensure consistent code formatting across the codebase
   - Apply ESLint and Prettier rules uniformly
   - Fix any linting errors or warnings

6. Test File Organization:
   - Reorganize test files to match the structure of the source files they test
   - Ensure all data-test-id selectors are properly referenced after file moves
   - Update import paths in test files

7. Documentation Updates:
   - Update README.md with the new project structure
   - Document any changes to development workflows
   - Update comments in code where necessary

8. Incremental Testing:
   - After each significant change, run the test suite to ensure functionality is maintained
   - Fix any broken references or paths immediately

9. Create a detailed pull request documenting all changes made and the rationale behind them.

# Test Strategy:
The testing strategy will verify that the cleanup maintains full functionality while improving code organization:

1. Incremental Testing:
   - After each significant reorganization step, run the full test suite to catch issues early
   - Document any test failures and their resolutions

2. Automated Tests:
   - Run all unit tests to verify component functionality remains intact
   - Execute all E2E tests using the data-test-id selectors to ensure UI flows still work
   - Verify that all integration tests pass with the reorganized code structure

3. Build Verification:
   - Perform a complete build of the application to ensure no build errors
   - Check for any warnings related to file paths or imports
   - Verify that the build output is consistent with previous builds

4. Manual Testing:
   - Test critical user flows manually:
     - RSVP functionality for free events
     - Ticketing and payment system
     - Google Calendar integration
     - Authentication flows
   - Verify that all UI elements render correctly

5. Git Operations:
   - Verify that .gitignore changes correctly exclude temporary files
   - Confirm that necessary local files are preserved
   - Check that no sensitive information is committed

6. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Verify application functionality in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
   - Test responsive design on different screen sizes
   - Ensure mobile functionality works as expected

7. Performance Check:
   - Compare application load times before and after cleanup
   - Verify that bundle size hasn't increased significantly

8. Code Review:
   - Have at least two team members review the changes
   - Verify that the new organization improves code readability and maintainability

9. Documentation Testing:
   - Verify that all documentation accurately reflects the new structure
   - Ensure README instructions work with the reorganized codebase

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Feature Branch and Analyze Repository Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new feature branch for the cleanup work and perform an initial analysis of the repository structure to identify misplaced files, unused dependencies, and areas needing organization.
### Details:
1. Create a new feature branch named `cleanup/repo-organization` from the main development branch
2. Analyze the current repository structure to identify:
   - Files in incorrect directories
   - Inconsistent naming patterns
   - Temporary files that should be excluded
   - Unused dependencies in package.json
3. Document findings in a structured format (e.g., spreadsheet or markdown file)
4. Create a plan for reorganization based on project conventions
