# Task ID: 23
# Title: Fix Critical RSVP Functionality Bugs
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve critical bugs in the RSVP system including authentication flow issues, database schema column mismatches, component interface conflicts, and code quality problems.
# Details:
This task involves fixing several critical issues in the RSVP functionality:

1. Authentication Flow Correction:
   - Restructure the RSVP API validation flow to perform authentication checks before validation
   - Implement proper middleware or guard patterns to ensure authenticated contexts
   - Update API route handlers to verify JWT tokens at the beginning of request processing

2. Database Schema Alignment:
   - Fix column name mismatches between code and database:
     - Change references from `display_name` to `full_name` (or vice versa) consistently
     - Standardize `published` vs `is_open_for_registration` field usage
   - Update TypeScript interfaces and database query functions to reflect correct column names
   - Add migration script if database schema changes are needed

3. Component Interface Resolution:
   - Resolve conflicts between TicketSelection and EventDetailClient components
   - Standardize prop interfaces and ensure consistent data flow
   - Fix any state management issues between these components
   - Ensure proper event handling and callback propagation

4. Code Quality Improvements:
   - Fix linting errors throughout RSVP-related code
   - Clean up unnecessary or incorrect imports
   - Remove unused variables and functions
   - Ensure consistent code style and formatting

Implementation should maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality while fixing the identified issues. Document any API changes that might affect other components.

# Test Strategy:
1. Authentication Flow Testing:
   - Write unit tests for the authentication middleware/guards
   - Test RSVP API endpoints with valid and invalid authentication tokens
   - Verify authentication checks occur before validation logic
   - Test error responses for unauthenticated requests

2. Database Schema Testing:
   - Create integration tests that verify correct column names are used in queries
   - Test data retrieval and storage with the corrected schema references
   - Verify existing data remains accessible after fixes
   - Run database migration tests if schema changes were implemented

3. Component Interface Testing:
   - Create unit tests for TicketSelection and EventDetailClient components
   - Test component interaction with mock data
   - Verify props are correctly passed between components
   - Test all user interaction flows (selecting tickets, submitting RSVPs)

4. End-to-End Testing:
   - Test complete RSVP flow from event detail page through confirmation
   - Verify guest RSVP functionality works correctly
   - Test RSVP cancellation process
   - Verify email confirmations are sent correctly

5. Code Quality Verification:
   - Run linting tools to ensure all linting errors are resolved
   - Verify no unused imports remain
   - Run the application in development mode to check for console warnings
   - Conduct code review to ensure consistent patterns are followed
