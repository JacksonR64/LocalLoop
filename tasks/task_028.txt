# Task ID: 28
# Title: Repository Rename from LocalLoop-V0.3 to LocalLoop
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 27
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update repository name across all references, configuration files, documentation, and any hardcoded references from LocalLoop-V0.3 to simply LocalLoop for production readiness.
# Details:
This task involves systematically updating the repository name from LocalLoop-V0.3 to LocalLoop across the entire codebase to prepare for production release:

1. Create a new feature branch named `update/repo-rename` from the main development branch.

2. Update repository configuration:
   - Rename the repository in GitHub/GitLab settings
   - Update package.json name field
   - Update any Docker container names or image references
   - Modify CI/CD pipeline configurations (.github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml, etc.)

3. Update code references:
   - Search for all instances of "LocalLoop-V0.3" in the codebase using grep or similar tool
   - Update import statements that reference the project name
   - Modify any absolute paths that include the repository name
   - Check for hardcoded URLs that might include the repository name

4. Update documentation:
   - Update README.md title and references
   - Modify any installation or setup instructions that reference the old name
   - Update API documentation if it contains the repository name
   - Check for references in CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, and other documentation files

5. Update deployment configurations:
   - Modify deployment scripts that reference the repository name
   - Update environment variables that might contain the old name
   - Check Kubernetes manifests, Docker Compose files, or other deployment configurations

6. Test local development setup:
   - Verify that the application builds correctly with the new name
   - Ensure all scripts and tools continue to work properly
   - Test that development environment setup instructions are accurate

7. Create a comprehensive pull request:
   - Document all changes made
   - Explain the purpose of the rename
   - List any areas that require special attention during review

8. After merging, verify production deployment:
   - Ensure CI/CD pipelines run correctly with the new name
   - Verify that the application deploys and functions properly in production

# Test Strategy:
To verify the repository rename has been successfully implemented:

1. Automated verification:
   - Create a script that searches for any remaining instances of "LocalLoop-V0.3" in the codebase
   - Run the script as part of the PR validation process
   - Add the script to the CI pipeline to prevent future regressions

2. Build and deployment testing:
   - Perform a clean build of the application to ensure no build errors
   - Run all existing automated tests to verify functionality remains intact
   - Deploy to a staging environment that mirrors production configuration
   - Verify that all deployment processes complete successfully

3. Manual verification:
   - Review GitHub/GitLab repository settings to confirm the name change
   - Check that documentation correctly references the new name
   - Verify that all links in documentation work properly
   - Test local development setup from scratch following updated instructions
   - Ensure new developers can clone and set up the project without issues

4. Cross-browser and device testing:
   - Verify application functionality in multiple browsers
   - Test on different device types to ensure responsive design still works
   - Check that any deep links or bookmarks continue to function

5. Integration testing:
   - Verify that any external services that interact with the repository still function
   - Test OAuth flows and API integrations that might reference the repository name
   - Ensure webhook configurations are updated if they contain the repository name

6. Post-deployment verification:
   - Monitor application logs for any errors related to the name change
   - Verify analytics and monitoring tools are properly configured with the new name
   - Check that all features continue to work in the production environment
