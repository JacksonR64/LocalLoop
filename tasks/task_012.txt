- Missing UI components resolved

## Implementation Plan
1. Create AttendeeManagement component for the attendees tab
2. Build API endpoints for fetching attendee data across events
3. Implement filtering/sorting capabilities
4. Add bulk actions for communication
5. Create check-in functionality for event management
6. Build attendee profile views with detailed information

## Database Schema Mapping

- Orders table: tickets purchased, payment status, user/guest info
- Tickets table: individual ticket details, attendee info, check-in status
- Users table: registered user profiles and preferences

## Technical Approach
- Replace placeholder in StaffDashboard attendees tab
- Create reusable components for attendee lists and filters
- Implement role-based access controls
- Use existing design patterns from events tab
- Support both registered users and guest attendees

## Current Focus
