## Issue #1 Resolution: Customer-side Ticket Loading for Paid Events

### Root Cause Analysis
- Identified critical API failure in ticket-types GET endpoint
- Frontend was passing event slugs (e.g., 'local-business-networking') 
- Backend API only accepted numeric IDs (e.g., '2') for sample events
- Resulted in 400 Bad Request errors when customers viewed paid event pages

### Implementation Details
- Added `getEventIdFromSlugOrId()` utility function in `/api/ticket-types/route.ts`
- Created comprehensive slug-to-ID mapping for all sample events:
  - 'local-business-networking' → '2'
  - 'kids-art-workshop' → '3' 
  - 'startup-pitch-night' → '7'
  - 'food-truck-festival' → '9'
- Modified GET endpoint handler to support both input formats
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing ID-based requests

### Verification
- Successfully tested with both slug and ID-based requests
- Confirmed `GET /api/ticket-types?event_id=local-business-networking` returns correct ticket data
- Verified customer-facing event pages now properly display available tickets
- No more 400 errors on event detail pages

### Next Steps
- Address Issue #2: staff dashboard ticket editing validation failures
- Consider implementing database-backed slug resolution for production

## Issue #2 Resolution: Workshop Event Ticket Loading Failures

### Root Cause Analysis
- Workshop events using real UUIDs failed with "Failed to load ticket information" error
- API endpoint only handled sample event IDs (1-4) but not real database UUIDs
- No proper error handling for invalid IDs or database lookup failures

### Implementation Details
- Extended GET endpoint with multi-stage lookup process:
  1. First checks sample data for demo events (Local Business Networking, etc.)
  2. If not found in sample data, validates input as UUID using regex
  3. Performs database query for valid UUIDs using Supabase client
  4. Returns appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
- Added UUID validation regex: `/^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i`
- Implemented proper error handling with status codes and messages

### Sales Period Fix
- Updated all sample ticket sale_end dates from 2025-05-12T16:00:00.000Z to 2026-05-12T16:00:00.000Z
- Extended by 1 year to prevent "sales period has ended" messages
- Verified API now returns updated dates with active sales periods

### Verification
- Successfully tested Local Business Networking event - now shows available tickets
- Workshop event page now properly loads ticket types from database
- Completed test purchase flow to verify end-to-end functionality
- Both "sales period ended" and "Failed to load ticket information" errors resolved
</info added on 2025-06-05T04:23:49.134Z>
<info added on 2025-06-05T04:41:03.090Z>
## Issue #3 Resolution: API Response Format Breaking Change

### Root Cause Analysis
- Previous fixes inadvertently changed the API response format from `{ "ticket_types": [...] }` to `{ "success": true, "tickets": [...] }`
- Frontend expected the original format with the `ticket_types` key
- This caused "ticketTypes is not iterable" errors in the staff dashboard
- All tickets disappeared from the UI due to this format mismatch

### Implementation Details
- Reverted API response format to the original structure: `{ "ticket_types": [...] }`
- Maintained all beneficial changes from previous fixes:
  - Slug-to-ID mapping functionality
  - Extended sale dates to 2026
  - UUID validation and multi-stage lookup
- Modified the return statement in the GET endpoint handler to use the correct key name

### Verification
- Confirmed `GET /api/ticket-types?event_id=local-business-networking` returns data with the correct format
- Verified Local Business Networking event page displays tickets with 2026 sale dates
- Staff dashboard now properly renders ticket information

### Known Issue
- Authorization error "Only event organizers can create ticket types" persists
- This appears to be a data/permission issue rather than a code bug
- Users need to verify they're logged in as the event organizer
- May require checking user role assignments in the database

## 6. Implement Secure Token Storage [done]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Store OAuth tokens securely to protect user data and maintain session continuity.
### Details:
Use secure storage mechanisms (such as encrypted files, secure databases, or OS-provided key stores) to save access and refresh tokens, ensuring they are protected from unauthorized access.
<info added on 2025-05-29T02:57:51.780Z>
## Analysis of Current Secure Token Storage Implementation

### What's Already Implemented in Task 4.5:

**✅ Encrypted Token Storage in Supabase**
- lib/google-auth.ts contains comprehensive token encryption/decryption functionality
- Uses Node.js crypto module with AES-256-GCM encryption
- Tokens are encrypted before storage in Supabase users table
- Implements proper salt/IV generation for security

**✅ Secure Database Schema**
- Users table already has encrypted Google Calendar token fields:
  - google_calendar_refresh_token (encrypted)
  - google_calendar_access_token (encrypted) 
  - google_calendar_expires_at (timestamp)
  - google_calendar_connected (boolean status)

**✅ Token Lifecycle Management**
- storeUserTokens() method encrypts and stores tokens securely
- getUserTokens() method decrypts tokens safely
- Automatic token refresh handling in getUserCalendarService()
- Connection status tracking and validation

**✅ Security Best Practices**
- Environment variable for encryption key (ENCRYPTION_KEY)
- Proper error handling for encryption/decryption failures
- No tokens stored in plain text anywhere
- CSRF protection via OAuth state parameter

### Areas That May Need Enhancement:

**🔍 Token Refresh Automation**
- Current implementation handles refresh manually when needed
- Could implement background job for proactive token refresh
- Add monitoring for token expiration

**🔍 Token Validation & Health Checks**
- Implement periodic validation of stored tokens
- Add health check endpoints for token status
- Monitor for revoked or expired tokens

**🔍 Security Audit & Hardening**
- Review encryption key management
- Add token access logging
- Implement rate limiting for token operations

### Implementation Plan for Task 4.6:

Based on analysis, the core secure token storage is already implemented. Focus areas:

1. **Token Refresh Automation**: Add proactive token refresh
2. **Health Monitoring**: Add token validation and monitoring
3. **Security Hardening**: Additional security measures and audit logging
4. **Documentation**: Document the secure storage implementation
