**Stripe Account Setup - Development Phase** üîë

**Implementation Approach:**
- Since we're in development, I'll configure Stripe test mode API keys
- Setting up environment variables for both test and production keys
- Creating comprehensive Stripe configuration with proper security

**Next Steps:**
1. Add Stripe environment variables to .env.local
2. Create Stripe configuration documentation
3. Add test API keys for development (production keys to be added during deployment)
4. Set up webhook endpoint URLs for both test and production environments

**Security Considerations:**
- Separate test/production key storage
- Environment variable validation
- Webhook signature verification setup
- Proper API key rotation documentation

## 2. Install Stripe libraries and SDK [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Install Stripe's libraries for both frontend and backend integration
### Details:
Add Stripe.js for frontend and appropriate server-side libraries (Node.js, Ruby, Python, etc.) based on your tech stack. Include React Stripe package if using React

## 3. Implement ticket type management system [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create database models and admin interface for managing different ticket types, prices, and availability
### Details:
Design database schema for ticket types with fields for name, description, price, capacity limits, and availability dates. Build admin CRUD interface for ticket management
<info added on 2025-05-29T21:57:44.331Z>
**Implementation Progress:**
- Stripe packages successfully installed and configured on both server and client-side

- Verified existing ticket_types table schema meets requirements with fields for name, description, price (in cents), capacity limits, and availability dates

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create RESTful API routes for ticket type management (/api/ticket-types)
   - GET /api/ticket-types - List all ticket types
   - GET /api/ticket-types/:id - Get specific ticket type
   - POST /api/ticket-types - Create new ticket type
   - PUT /api/ticket-types/:id - Update ticket type
   - DELETE /api/ticket-types/:id - Remove ticket type

2. Develop TypeScript interfaces:
   ```typescript
   interface TicketType {
     id: string;
     event_id: string;
     name: string;
     description: string;
     price: number; // in cents
     capacity: number;
     sort_order: number;
     sale_starts_at: Date;
     sale_ends_at: Date;
   }
   ```

3. Build admin UI components for ticket management:
   - TicketTypeList component
   - TicketTypeForm component with validation
   - Price calculator with Stripe fee estimation

4. Integrate with event management system to associate ticket types with specific events

5. Implement testing suite for ticket creation and pricing functionality

## 4. Develop checkout flow with Stripe integration [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Build the checkout process that collects customer information and integrates with Stripe for payment processing
### Details:
Create checkout form, implement Stripe Elements for secure card collection, create PaymentIntent on the server, and handle successful/failed payments

## 5. Implement guest checkout functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Create a streamlined checkout process for non-registered users
### Details:
Design guest checkout flow that collects minimal required information, implement email verification if needed, and ensure proper session handling for guest users

## 6. Build order and ticket storage system [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Develop database models and logic to store order information and generate tickets after successful payment
### Details:
Create database schema for orders and tickets, implement logic to generate unique ticket identifiers, and build system to associate tickets with users (registered or guest)

## 7. Set up Stripe webhook handling [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.6
### Description: Configure webhook endpoints to receive and process payment events from Stripe
### Details:
Create webhook endpoint, implement signature verification for security, handle various event types (payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.failed, etc.), and update order status accordingly

## 8. Implement ticket capacity enforcement [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.6
### Description: Create logic to track and enforce ticket availability and prevent overselling
### Details:
Implement real-time capacity tracking, reservation system during checkout process, and timeout mechanism for abandoned carts to release reserved tickets
<info added on 2025-05-30T02:16:16.676Z>
**Analysis of Current Capacity Enforcement:**

‚úÖ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED:**
- Basic capacity checking in checkout API (lines 107-123)
- Real-time sold ticket counting vs ticket type capacity
- Prevention of overselling with proper error messages
- Available count calculation and validation

‚ùå **MISSING FUNCTIONALITY:**
- **Cart Reservation System**: No temporary reservation of tickets during checkout process
- **Timeout Mechanism**: No cleanup of abandoned cart reservations
- **Race Condition Protection**: Multiple users could start checkout simultaneously for last tickets

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create `ticket_reservations` table for temporary holds
2. Reserve tickets when checkout starts (PaymentIntent creation)
3. Implement cleanup job for expired reservations (15-minute timeout)
4. Update capacity checking to account for active reservations
5. Release reservations on payment success/failure

**Priority:** This prevents overselling during high-demand ticket releases and improves user experience.

### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8
### Description: Create and execute test cases for the entire payment and ticketing system
