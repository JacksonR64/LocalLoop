Successfully completed EventMap integration into event detail page. Selected and implemented Leaflet through react-leaflet packages for the mapping solution. Created an EventMap component with dynamic imports to prevent server-side rendering issues. Implemented comprehensive loading states and error handling for various failure scenarios. Added mock geocoding functionality as a placeholder for the production geocoding service. The map features interactive markers with popups displaying event details and a "Get Directions" button that opens Google Maps in a new tab. The component has been fully integrated into the event detail page, replacing the previous placeholder. All component exports have been properly updated in events/index.ts, and the build verification confirms all functionality is working as expected. The implementation includes technical features such as dynamic imports to prevent SSR issues, loading spinner during initialization, error handling with fallback UI, responsive design for both mobile and desktop, and a mock coordinates system ready for integration with a production geocoding API.
