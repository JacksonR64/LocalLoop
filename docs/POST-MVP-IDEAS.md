## 📅 Enhanced Calendar Integration

### Smart Add to Calendar Button Variations
*Priority: Medium | Complexity: Low-Medium*

Currently we have one universal "add to calendar" button. Post-MVP, create intelligent variations:

#### 1. **Paid Events - No Ticket Purchased**
- **Behavior**: Creates a "draft" calendar entry 
- **Content**: "Remember to buy ticket for [Event Name]"
- **Style**: Different visual indicator (dashed border, pencil icon)
- **Action**: Links to ticket purchase page

#### 2. **Paid Events - Ticket Purchased** 
- **Behavior**: Creates full calendar event with ticket details
- **Content**: Complete event info + ticket confirmation details
- **Includes**: QR code, ticket type, seat info, order ID
- **Style**: Standard solid button

#### 3. **Free Events**
- **Behavior**: Similar to purchased ticket version
- **Content**: Full event details with RSVP confirmation
- **Includes**: RSVP status, attendee count

#### 4. **Social Sharing Features** *(Future)*
- Send calendar invite to friends
- Share ticket details via calendar invite
- Group calendar coordination
