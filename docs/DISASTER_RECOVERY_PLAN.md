## 🔧 Recovery Procedures

### **1. Initial Assessment (0-15 minutes)**

#### **Rapid Diagnosis Checklist**
```bash
□ Check system status dashboard
□ Verify Vercel deployment status
□ Check Supabase database connectivity
□ Test critical user flows (login, RSVP, checkout)
□ Review recent deployments/configuration changes
□ Check third-party service status (Stripe, Google)
□ Assess scope: all users vs. subset vs. specific features
```

#### **Impact Assessment**
```bash
# Quick impact evaluation
AFFECTED_USERS="[all|subset|percentage]"
AFFECTED_FEATURES="[core|payments|notifications|etc]"
ESTIMATED_REVENUE_IMPACT="[per hour]"
CUSTOMER_COMPLAINTS="[volume/severity]"
```

### **2. Immediate Containment (15-30 minutes)**

#### **System Isolation**
```bash
# If security incident suspected
vercel env rm PRODUCTION_API_KEYS  # Rotate compromised keys
supabase auth admin user-ban --uid <compromised_users>

# If database corruption detected
./scripts/ops/emergency-db-snapshot.sh  # Create point-in-time snapshot
```

#### **Rollback Procedures**
```bash
# Emergency rollback to last known good state
vercel rollback  # Rollback to previous deployment
git revert HEAD~1  # Revert recent commits if needed

# Database rollback (if needed)
supabase db reset --db-url=$RECOVERY_DB_URL
```

### **3. System Recovery (30 minutes - 4 hours)**

#### **Database Recovery**
```bash
# Point-in-time recovery
./scripts/ops/restore-database.sh --timestamp="2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"

# Full database restoration
./scripts/ops/restore-database.sh --backup-file="localloop_backup_20240115_103000.sql"

# Verify data integrity
./scripts/ops/verify-data-integrity.sh
```

#### **Application Recovery**
```bash
# Clean deployment
npm ci  # Fresh dependency install
npm run build  # Clean build
vercel deploy --prod  # Deploy to production

# Configuration restoration
./scripts/ops/restore-config.sh --env=production
```

#### **Third-Party Service Recovery**
```bash
# Google Calendar re-authentication
./scripts/google-calendar-reconnect.sh

# Stripe webhook verification
./scripts/verify-stripe-webhooks.sh

# Email service validation
./scripts/test-email-delivery.sh
```

### **4. Service Validation (Recovery + 30 minutes)**

#### **Comprehensive Testing Checklist**
```bash
□ User authentication (Google OAuth)
□ Event creation and management
□ RSVP functionality
□ Payment processing (test transactions)
□ Email notifications (welcome, confirmations, reminders)
□ Calendar integration (event sync)
□ Mobile responsiveness
□ Performance benchmarks (<2s load times)
□ Security headers and HTTPS
□ Database queries and reports
```

#### **Automated Recovery Validation**
```bash
# Run automated recovery tests
npm run test:recovery
./scripts/validate-system-health.sh
./scripts/performance-benchmark.sh
```
