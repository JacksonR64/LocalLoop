# LocalLoop Application Architecture

## System Overview

LocalLoop is a lightweight, community events platform designed for small local organisations to share and manage events with community members. It supports both free and paid events, allowing users to RSVP, purchase tickets, and **add events directly to their Google Calendar via Google Calendar API integration** â€” all via a mobile-friendly web app.

### Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** Next.js (from 1000x-app template) with Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, RLS)
* **Calendar Integration:** **Google Calendar API with OAuth 2.0** (Primary Client Requirement)
* **Payments:** Stripe (checkout, webhooks)
* **Testing:** Playwright E2E
* **Deployment:** Vercel
* **Optional:** Resend or Mailgun (emails), PostHog (later for analytics)

### Key Differentiators
Unlike platforms like Eventbrite, LocalLoop:
* Emphasises **community-first UX** with mobile-friendly RSVP tools
* Offers **staff dashboards** for simple event control
* **Integrates directly with Google Calendar API** for one-click event creation (Client Requirement)
* Provides **fallback .ics downloads** for non-Google calendar users
* Allows **guest access** for fast RSVP or ticket flow
* Provides a foundation for future **social and native features**

## ðŸ”‘ Critical Client Requirement: Google Calendar API Integration

**PRIMARY REQUIREMENT:** Direct Google Calendar API integration for seamless event addition to users' calendars.

### Implementation Requirements:
- **Google Calendar API v3** integration

* **Separate calendar permissions** that can be granted independently of account creation
* **Guest calendar access** through temporary OAuth sessions
* **Permission management** allowing users to revoke calendar access easily

### How should we handle Google Calendar API failures and provide fallbacks?
* **Primary:** Direct Google Calendar API event creation
* **Secondary:** Automatic .ics file generation and download
* **Tertiary:** Manual calendar instructions with event details
* **Error tracking:** Log failures for monitoring and improvement

### What caching strategy should be implemented for Google Calendar integration?
* **Token caching** with automatic refresh before expiration
* **Event metadata caching** to avoid redundant API calls
* **User permission caching** to reduce authentication overhead

### What is the best approach for implementing calendar integration across different platforms?
* **Primary:** Google Calendar API with OAuth 2.0 (Client Requirement)
* **Secondary:** Generate .ics files for universal import
* **Tertiary:** Offer "Add to Calendar" buttons for major platforms
* **Future:** Direct API integrations with Apple and Microsoft calendars

### How should we structure the API to support both web and future mobile clients?
* Use Supabase-generated REST + RPC endpoints for data access
* **Dedicated Google Calendar API endpoints** for authentication and event management
* Abstract shared logic into backend Edge Functions
